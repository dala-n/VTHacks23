## **HomeIQ**

Real Estate and Demographics, Unified. Enter a zip code, explore listings, and access vital demographic data for smarter decisions. Find your dream property or next investment opportunity with HomeIQ!

## Inspiration
We were inspired to create HomeIQ to explore areas of web development and data analysis we were not familiar with and to learn something new from this event by tackling CoStar's real estate hack.

## What it does
HomeIQ combines 2023 real estate data with 2017 US Census demographic data, allowing users to explore real estate listings by entering a zip code while also providing essential demographic information for that area.
